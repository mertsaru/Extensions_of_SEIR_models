# Extensions of SEIR model SEI<sup>3</sup>RD and SEI<sup>3</sup>Q<sup>3</sup>RD
Julia codes of SEI<sup>3</sup>RD and SEI<sup>3</sup>Q<sup>3</sup>RD
This is a project I did to analyze COVID-19 and predict it's outcome on Turkey with Differential Equations. It uses extended Differential models such as SE<sup>3</sup>RD and SEI<sup>3</sup>Q<sup>3</sup>RD.
